10 <start> gut@@ ach incre@@ ased safety for pedestri@@ ans <end>
35 <start> they are not even 100 metres apart on tuesday the new b 33 pedestrian lights in dorf@@ park@@ platz in gut@@ ach became operational within view of the existing town hall traffic lights <end>
19 <start> two sets of lights so close to one another inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error <end>
14 <start> yesterday gut@@ acht &apos;s mayor gave a clear answer to this question <end>
24 <start> &quot; at the time the town hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route &quot; explained eck@@ ert yesterday <end>
23 <start> the k@@ lus@@ er lights protect cycli@@ sts as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of ber@@ gle <end>
21 <start> the system which officially became operational yesterday is of importance to the sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg kirch@@ strasse junction <end>
34 <start> we have the museum two churches the spa gardens the bus stop a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank not to mention the traffic from the &apos; gru@@ b &apos; residential area <end>
25 <start> &quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety &quot; said eck@@ ert <end>
16 <start> this was also confirmed by peter arn@@ old from the offen@@ burg district office <end>
41 <start> &quot; according to current measurements around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of gut@@ ach on the b@@ 33 on a daily basis of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent &quot; emphasised arn@@ old <end>
28 <start> therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary &quot; here safety comes first it &apos;s that simple &quot; said arn@@ old <end>
41 <start> a total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a round@@ about was also considered however this idea was rejected on account of the narro@@ wn@@ ess of the sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg kirch@@ strasse jun@@ ctions <end>
63 <start> according to arn@@ old every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts &quot; using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree tr@@ un@@ ks we also tested whether such vehicles could access the b 33 from the sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg without kno@@ cking over the traffic light posts &quot; <end>
30 <start> the traffic light system itself which cost around eur 15@@ ,000 is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market &quot; explained arn@@ old <end>
30 <start> the system is fitted with coloured le@@ ds which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights even when the sun is low in the sky <end>
25 <start> and they are also energy @-@ efficient the older light systems consume around 100 wat@@ ts with the new ones consuming just eight <end>
12 <start> there are three sets of lights per direction of travel <end>
19 <start> arn@@ old explained the technology used by the new system it is fitted with two radar sensors <end>
20 <start> if the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights the top radar sensor checks the traffic status <end>
25 <start> if the street is clear the pedestrian ob@@ tains a green light immediately if not there is a delay of around 15 seconds <end>
17 <start> an additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended <end>
34 <start> &quot; if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street the green phase is extended thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street &quot; explained arn@@ old <end>
17 <start> of course drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road <end>
28 <start> yesterday this was not the case the light had barely turned green for pedestri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light <end>

8 <start> a black box in your car <end>
47 <start> as america &apos;s road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to m@@ end a cru@@ mb@@ ling highway system many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car <end>
45 <start> the devices which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and transmit that information to bureau@@ crats are at the center of a controversial attempt in washington and state planning offices to over@@ haul the outdated system for funding america &apos;s major roads <end>
20 <start> the usually d@@ ull arena of highway planning has suddenly spa@@ wned intense debate and colorful alli@@ ances <end>
44 <start> liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lob@@ bying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive and possibly where you drive them then use the information to draw up a tax bill <end>
8 <start> the tea party is ag@@ hast <end>
17 <start> the american civil liberties union is deeply concerned too raising a variety of privacy issues <end>
17 <start> and while congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed several states are not waiting <end>
27 <start> they are exploring how over the next decade they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over <end>
25 <start> th@@ ous@@ ands of mot@@ ori@@ sts have already taken the black boxes some of which have gps monitoring for a test drive <end>
10 <start> this really is a must for our nation <end>
52 <start> &quot; it is not a matter of something we might choose to do &quot; said has@@ an i@@ k@@ hr@@ ata executive director of the southern california ass@@ n@@ of governments which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every california motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 <end>
15 <start> there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes <end>
9 <start> the technology is there to do it <end>
23 <start> the push comes as the country &apos;s highway trust fund financed with taxes americans pay at the gas pump is broke <end>
13 <start> americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to <end>
11 <start> cars get many more miles to the gall@@ on <end>
21 <start> the federal tax itself 18.@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years <end>
21 <start> poli@@ ti@@ cians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one p@@ enny when gas prices are high <end>
28 <start> &quot; the gas tax is just not sustainable &quot; said lee mun@@ n@@ ich a transportation policy expert at the university of m@@ inn@@ es@@ ota <end>
21 <start> his state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay @-@ by @-@ mile system <end>
18 <start> &quot; this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term &quot; he said <end>
14 <start> w@@ on@@ ks call it a mile@@ age @-@ based user fee <end>
38 <start> it is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als as the taxes could be rig@@ ged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ gestion and greenhouse gases for example <end>
29 <start> california plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they dev@@ ise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws <end>
32 <start> but rep@@ bill shu@@ ster r @-@ p@@ a chairman of the house transpor@@ tation committee has said he too sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative <end>
22 <start> the free mark@@ ete@@ ers at the re@@ ason foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per mile <end>
26 <start> &quot; this is not just a tax going into a black hole &quot; said adri@@ an moore vice president of policy at re@@ ason <end>
12 <start> people are paying more directly into what they are getting <end>
34 <start> the movement is also bol@@ stered by two former u.s. transpor@@ tation sec@@ ret@@ aries who in a 2011 report urged congress to move in the pay @-@ per @-@ mile direction <end>
21 <start> the u.s. senate approved a 90 @-@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars <end>
34 <start> but the house leadership killed the proposal acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town <end>
13 <start> several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own <end>
21 <start> the most eager is o@@ reg@@ on which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment <end>
18 <start> those drivers will soon pay the mile@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state <end>
8 <start> nevada has already completed a pilot <end>
9 <start> new york city is looking into one <end>
14 <start> il@@ lin@@ ois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks <end>
38 <start> and the i @-@ 95 co@@ alition which includes 17 state transportation departments along the eastern se@@ aboard including mar@@ yland penn@@ sylvania virginia and florida is studying how they could go about implementing the change <end>
9 <start> the concept is not a universal hit <end>
32 <start> in nevada where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move <end>
39 <start> &quot; conc@@ erns about big bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem &quot; said al@@ au@@ d@@ din khan who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the nevada department of transpor@@ tation <end>
8 <start> it was not something people wanted <end>
35 <start> as the trial got underway the ac@@ l@@ u of nevada warned on its website &quot; it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full @-@ fle@@ dged tracking devices &quot; <end>
32 <start> there is no need to build an enormous un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings <end>
40 <start> nevada is among several states now scra@@ mb@@ ling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven but not exactly where and at what time <end>
14 <start> if you can do that khan said the public gets more comfortable <end>
25 <start> the h@@ unt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small california star@@ tu@@ p called true mi@@ le@@ age <end>
15 <start> the firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers <end>
24 <start> it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance in which drivers would pay based on their mile@@ age <end>
32 <start> but the devices it is testing appeal to highway plann@@ ers because they don &apos;t use gps and deliver a limited amount of information up@@ loaded perio@@ dically by modem <end>
37 <start> &quot; people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location &quot; said ryan mor@@ rison chief executive of true mi@@ le@@ age <end>
15 <start> there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs <end>
17 <start> there are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this <end>
16 <start> in o@@ reg@@ on plann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices <end>
11 <start> they can choose a device with or without gps <end>
33 <start> or they can choose not to have a device at all op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents <end>
23 <start> other places are hoping to sell the concept to a war@@ y public by having the devices do more not less <end>
59 <start> in new york city transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees provide &quot; pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ drive &quot; insurance and create a pool of real @-@ time speed data from other drivers that mot@@ ori@@ sts could use to avoid traffic <end>
28 <start> &quot; mot@@ ori@@ sts would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them &quot; says a city planning document <end>
23 <start> some transportation plann@@ ers though wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distra@@ ction <end>
33 <start> at the metro@@ politan transpor@@ tation commission in the san francisco bay area officials say congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rupt highway trust fund by raising gas taxes <end>
34 <start> an extra one @-@ time or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas so they pay their fair share <end>
38 <start> &quot; there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an asp@@ ir@@ in &quot; said rand@@ y r@@ entsch@@ ler the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs <end>
23 <start> if we do this hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things <end>
11 <start> k√∂nigs@@ feld small team gives a spiri@@ ted performance <end>
22 <start> the voluntary fire service bra@@ vely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel <end>
10 <start> only eleven men took part in the exercise <end>
20 <start> for the training exercise department commander hans kammer@@ er chose the f@@ eder premises on burg@@ berger strasse <end>
15 <start> a short @-@ circuit was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ wing <end>
24 <start> two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke however one was able to make an emergency call <end>
27 <start> two fire fighters equipped with resp@@ ir@@ atory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by hans kammer@@ er <end>
20 <start> after a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building <end>
9 <start> the second person had to be carried <end>
17 <start> this was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stair@@ well <end>
18 <start> the building a workshop with integrated stab@@ ling for two horses was not easy to secure <end>
16 <start> there were large quantities of wood and bal@@ es of stra@@ w stored inside <end>
14 <start> in addition to this there were also electrical machines for wood processing <end>
20 <start> the first attempt to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine <end>
16 <start> another line was taken from the surface hy@@ d@@ rant around 100 metres away <end>
15 <start> only three attempts could be made to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the bla@@ ze <end>
15 <start> a hol@@ low @-@ stream no@@ zzle in the building was also used <end>

10 <start> net@@ working between universities and companies is important <end>
41 <start> on a visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau @-@ hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald it was explained to parliamentary president gui@@ do wolf in ti@@ ti@@ see @-@ neu@@ stadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from <end>
39 <start> in the hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald support centre he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the vocational col@@ leges and the district gram@@ mar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council <end>
38 <start> &quot; education is an important factor for the location &quot; highlighted clau@@ dia steh@@ le director of the hans th@@ oma school which introduced the net@@ worked hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald education centre scho@@ ols project <end>
13 <start> during the presentation wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project <end>
31 <start> since 2011 there has been successful collaboration in w√§l@@ der@@ stadt between the support centre the district gra@@ mm@@ ar school and the v@@ oc@@ ational school comple@@ x <end>
14 <start> he also pra@@ ised the family @-@ friendly approach within the district <end>
39 <start> &quot; it is important not only to keep the family life stage in mind but on account of demographic change the period spent providing long @-@ term care and support for relatives as well &quot; explained wolf <end>
24 <start> he also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long @-@ term care and support of relatives <end>
26 <start> &quot; without support from their employer the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract &quot; said wolf <end>
13 <start> however nobody can afford to lose qualified workers &quot; he added <end>
14 <start> another particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies <end>
48 <start> &quot; after all people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region along with their acquired knowledge and skills which contributes to the strengthening of the region &quot; said the state parliamentary president expressing his thorough conviction <end>
25 <start> for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered <end>
28 <start> in his opinion the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south @-@ west germany in immediate proximity to france and switzerland <end>
32 <start> in addition to this on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ see @-@ neu@@ stadt to freiburg he experienced first @-@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport <end>
33 <start> &quot; you must continue to be ten@@ acious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance <end>

65 <start> in the days before the kil@@ big aut@@ um@@ n fol@@ k festival when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard a small corner wall with b@@ alu@@ stra@@ des was installed to stabili@@ se and relie@@ ve the static load on the old natural stone wall which is more than one hundred years old <end>
46 <start> according to alexander mis@@ ok of the b@@ r√§@@ un@@ lingen municip@@ al plan@@ ning and building control authority the ongoing procedure plans to involve the regional memorial authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall <end>
33 <start> a cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals which will then be submitted to the town council which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure <end>
13 <start> a decision is expected to be made in the coming year <end>
52 <start> following the renovation pla@@ stering and plan@@ ting of trees in the old internal school yard within the two wings of the 19@@ 12 school as a subsequent measure the boundary wall which is in need of refurb@@ ishment must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future <end>
51 <start> the historic one hundred @-@ year @-@ old boundary wall between the old school @-@ yard and kirch@@ strasse is in need of renovation primarily as a result of water and fro@@ st damage on account of the lack of dra@@ in@@ age and is le@@ aning for@@ wards <end>
28 <start> deep cra@@ cks in a number of individual stones testi@@ fy to the weather damage however at present the wall is not in danger of collapse <end>
27 <start> a secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils and this is the purpose of the current forti@@ fication work <end>
27 <start> the school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 2009 however high un@@ planned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back <end>
25 <start> the regional memorial authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation which has even been used for fil@@ ming <end>
29 <start> if this authority were to impose requirements then the town of b@@ r√§@@ un@@ lingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument pre@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists <end>
41 <start> the pupils of the b@@ r√§@@ un@@ lingen pri@@ mary school who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building with a new hall will soon be able to use the old school yard as well <end>

22 <start> both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug car@@ tels <end>
20 <start> since 2006 more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in mexico <end>
5 <start> built by experts <end>
33 <start> due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel investig@@ ators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year <end>
22 <start> the railway system was equipped in such a way that electri@@ cally powered car@@ ts could be used on it <end>
19 <start> on the mexican side the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border <end>
20 <start> according to the authorities a lad@@ der runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel <end>
20 <start> the tunnel has a cross @-@ section measuring 1.@@ 20 metres high and 90 cen@@ timet@@ res across <end>
14 <start> it would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the usa <end>
17 <start> two of the sus@@ pects were detained in conjunction with the co@@ ca@@ ine find <end>
19 <start> the third a mexican was detained due to the sei@@ z@@ ure of the mari@@ ju@@ ana <end>
15 <start> all three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment according to the authorities <end>
20 <start> since 2006 eight tun@@ nels of this type have been discovered the press conference in san diego continued <end>
19 <start> however this was the first time that co@@ ca@@ ine was found in such a tunnel construction <end>

31 <start> this venue will be completed and inau@@ gur@@ ated in the anniversary year with the official date set for the last weekend in september on 27 and 28 september <end>
21 <start> on the occasion of the gei@@ s@@ ingen town anniversary a new chron@@ ic@@ le will also be published <end>
62 <start> &quot; however it will not merely be a chron@@ ic@@ le of gei@@ s@@ ingen itself but rather a printed work on the gei@@ s@@ ingen of today which now consists of gei@@ s@@ ingen kirchen @-@ hau@@ sen leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen a@@ ul@@ fin@@ gen and gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen &quot; said mayor walter h@@ eng@@ st@@ ler <end>
32 <start> and the gei@@ s@@ ingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014 as it was in 1974 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were completed <end>
25 <start> the new chron@@ ic@@ le is to be presented on 21 or 22 november in the new festival hall in gei@@ s@@ ingen <end>
16 <start> however 2014 is also a year of many anni@@ vers@@ aries in other respects <end>
85 <start> the nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki f@@ ool &apos;s guil@@ d celebration begins on 8 february with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60 @-@ year anniversary the harmonie gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 march will hold a celeb@@ ratory ban@@ quet and then from 1 to 4 may will be celebrating the bezir@@ ks@@ fest &#91; district music festival &#93; <end>
79 <start> the leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen n@@ ur@@ sing home will turn 40 years old the gei@@ s@@ ingen school has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 may and the poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the brun@@ nen@@ fest &#91; fo@@ un@@ tain festival &#93; from 4 to 7 july <end>
36 <start> the town of gei@@ s@@ ingen was first officially documented in the year 7@@ 64 in a de@@ ed of donation which is now in the possession of the st. g@@ allen mon@@ astery <end>
23 <start> the de@@ ed was drawn up in kirchen hau@@ sen which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thouse <end>
12 <start> both communities are thus mentioned in the same de@@ ed <end>
37 <start> one reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,@@ 250 @-@ year anniversary in this way is that it also coinci@@ des with the 40@@ th anniversary of the community reform gemein@@ der@@ e@@ form <end>
9 <start> council sets its sights on rail system <end>
23 <start> should the &quot; am hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing be re@@ constructed at great cost in order to increase traffic safety <end>
12 <start> the town councils have decided that the answer is yes <end>
17 <start> schil@@ ta@@ ch will have to contribute up to eur 2@@ 20,000 to the project <end>
19 <start> the deutsche bahn hopes to improve the kin@@ zi@@ gt@@ al railway line in the coming year <end>
27 <start> in particular safety at railway cross@@ ings is to be increased colli@@ sions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country <end>
32 <start> if the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures they will be required to contribute one third of the costs with the remainder divided between deutsche bahn and the federal government <end>
31 <start> schil@@ ta@@ ch &apos;s town master mas@@ on roland grie@@ √ü@@ haber explained the peculi@@ arities of the &quot; am hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing to the town council <end>
26 <start> at the crossing the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line <end>
32 <start> lar@@ ger vehicles for example those that transport long logs would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traffic without having to block the railway line <end>
40 <start> grie@@ √ü@@ haber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course wi@@ den the ad@@ joining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic <end>
57 <start> this was the subject of controversial discussion in the town council as some council members cast doubt over the need to wi@@ den the road thomas ki@@ pp summar@@ ised the perspective of the critics with this statement &quot; do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles &quot; <end>
25 <start> mayor thomas ha@@ as re@@ tor@@ ted the &quot; hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs <end>
55 <start> even wood from the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route as the vehicles which measure 20 metres in length would not be able to use the route via the h√§@@ ber@@ les bridge as they would not be able to make the turn on the haupt@@ strasse <end>
32 <start> furthermore when the haupt@@ strasse is blocked the route would also serve as a byp@@ ass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel argued ha@@ as <end>
51 <start> given that it is likely that the kirch@@ berg and schloss@@ berg tunnel will have to be re@@ constructed and renovated as is currently the case in wol@@ fach the &quot; am hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time <end>
27 <start> the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned wi@@ dening of the road would inc@@ ur <end>
59 <start> nevertheless the reconstruction of the railway crossing was con@@ s@@ ented to by a majority on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could if required extend the connecting road in the &quot; bahn@@ hof@@ stra√üe &quot; direction to around 5.@@ 5 metres to accommodate on@@ coming traffic <end>
42 <start> the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the trau@@ tw@@ ein t@@ ann@@ ery could on the other hand bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h√§user weg &quot; <end>
41 <start> the administ@@ rative department had deutsche bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er engineering office as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h√§user weg will be straightforward <end>
30 <start> the investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inc@@ lin@@ ation of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck <end>
17 <start> the town as the authority responsible for road construction would then bear responsibility for this <end>
10 <start> the reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes <end>
32 <start> because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be con@@ s@@ ented to argued ha@@ as <end>
53 <start> at this point the risk of a train colli@@ sion with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway cross@@ ings on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sight directly alongside the stopping point <end>
26 <start> the trains themselves coming from the central station must also be sufficiently slo@@ wed down so that there is no threat of colli@@ sion <end>
62 <start> according to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority as the town of schil@@ ta@@ ch would &quot; bear the br@@ unt of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck since the deutsche bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work <end>
40 <start> the committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; vor heu@@ bach &quot; and &apos; vor ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; railway cross@@ ings for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with deutsche bahn to be un@@ problematic <end>
14 <start> esa makes decision on major space missions mis@@ sions co@@ sting billions <end>
35 <start> di@@ stant plan@@ ets gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black holes experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years <end>
17 <start> there were 30 proposals to choose from five of which are still in the running <end>
5 <start> di@@ stant worlds <end>
15 <start> astronom@@ ers have already found more than 1,000 plan@@ ets near other stars <end>
17 <start> whether or not life exists on at least some of these no @-@ one knows <end>
16 <start> the choice is a difficult one should we search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves <end>
13 <start> or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmo@@ s <end>
22 <start> or search for plan@@ ets similar to the earth and thus perhaps discover ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ re@@ stri@@ al life <end>
18 <start> these are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the european space agency esa <end>
26 <start> for their &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme they are looking for ideas for two major space projects which should greatly advance research <end>
20 <start> the budget for &quot; l @-@ mis@@ sions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion euro <end>
14 <start> the projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 <end>
25 <start> at the beginning of september the elite in the field of european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions <end>
19 <start> 30 ideas were up for debate of which five have now made it onto the short list <end>
13 <start> numerous panels are assessing the proposals posing questions to the researchers <end>
18 <start> over the coming days a final decision is to be made by the scientific programme committee <end>
33 <start> in total four main questions were chosen by the esa to which the missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme initiated in 2007 are to find the answers <end>
15 <start> what are the conditions required for the formation of plan@@ ets and life <end>
36 <start> the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clou@@ ds and thus the formation of the plan@@ ets that or@@ bit these stars lie in pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dark@@ ness <end>
18 <start> a large inf@@ ra @-@ red teles@@ cope in space could penet@@ rate this dark@@ ness <end>
16 <start> and if a star has plan@@ ets under what circumstances can life exist there <end>
40 <start> in order to pursue this question the &quot; che@@ ops &quot; space teles@@ cope is to be launched in 20@@ 17 with which 500 known plan@@ etary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail <end>
20 <start> the possibilities are however limited che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euro <end>
41 <start> with larger instruments astronom@@ ers could map plan@@ ets similar to earth and even analyse the composition of their atmosp@@ heres and thus search for &quot; biom@@ ark@@ ers &quot; gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity <end>
8 <start> how does the solar system function <end>
17 <start> this question should also provide information regarding the pre@@ conditions for the origins of life <end>
25 <start> the magnetic activity of a star the interaction of its magnetic field and the emit@@ ted partic@@ le radiation play an important role <end>
22 <start> it is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere <end>
35 <start> with the &quot; solar or@@ bit@@ er &quot; the esa has already approved an m @-@ class mission for which the budget stands at around half a million euro to address this matter <end>
22 <start> the probe is to be launched in 20@@ 17 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun <end>
16 <start> jup@@ iter and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the researchers <end>
21 <start> they want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system <end>
31 <start> the esa is planning that the first of the total of three l @-@ mis@@ sions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme will address this subject <end>
24 <start> the &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; jup@@ iter i@@ cy mo@@ ons explorer probe is planned to begin its journey in 20@@ 22 <end>
36 <start> ei@@ ght years later it will reach jup@@ iter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ic@@ y mo@@ ons europa cal@@ list@@ o and g@@ any@@ me@@ de <end>
12 <start> what are the basic physical laws of the uni@@ verse <end>
30 <start> o@@ uter space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature as known to us are still valid there <end>
31 <start> there may also be devi@@ ations that could show physi@@ cians the path to a new theory under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united <end>
14 <start> how did the universe come about and what does it consist of <end>
17 <start> 13.@@ 7 billion years ago our cosmo@@ s was created by the big b@@ ang <end>
55 <start> al@@ ongside the materials familiar to us from which stars plan@@ ets and life forms such as ourselves are composed there exists dark matter the gra@@ vit@@ ational force of which holds galax@@ ies and galax@@ y clu@@ sters together and dark energy the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe <end>
29 <start> thus far researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the big b@@ ang nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of <end>
23 <start> with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; the esa has already approved an m @-@ mission planned to comm@@ ence in 2020 <end>
38 <start> with a special teles@@ cope the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy <end>
11 <start> pro@@ pos@@ als that are in the running ... <end>
17 <start> of the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure <end>
41 <start> the proposal with the best chance of approval as an l @-@ mission in the opinion of many experts is &quot; e @-@ lisa &quot; a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves <end>
26 <start> many physi@@ cians perc@@ eive this to entail changes in the structure of space @-@ time which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago <end>
11 <start> to date they have never been proved to exist <end>
14 <start> the scientists behind the project hope that eli@@ sa could achieve this <end>
19 <start> the mission involves placing a det@@ ector consisting of two or three prob@@ es in outer space <end>
32 <start> unlike systems on earth it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created during the big b@@ ang and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmo@@ s <end>
87 <start> four other proposals are still competing for the second l @-@ mission place a large x @-@ ray teles@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; which among other things would research black holes &quot; i@@ cy plan@@ ets &quot; another mission to the outer plan@@ ets of the solar system &quot; pr@@ ism &quot; a mission for the measurement of co@@ sm@@ ic background radiation and the &quot; ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et fin@@ der &quot; which would find and investigate plan@@ ets similar to earth <end>
40 <start> among others proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from mars conducting research on the moon ven@@ us and ast@@ ero@@ ids as well as proposals in the area of solar physics <end>
14 <start> snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany over us surveillance <end>
49 <start> edward snow@@ den the us intelligence whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer has declared that he is willing to travel to berlin to give evidence to the german parliament if the us national security agency and its director kei@@ th alexander fail to provide answers about its activities <end>
31 <start> german mp hans @-@ christian str√∂@@ bel@@ e on thursday met mr snow@@ den in russia where he has been granted asylum to discuss him testi@@ fying in germany <end>
59 <start> a letter from mr snow@@ den presented to the media in berlin on friday by the mp said &quot; though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence &quot; <end>
10 <start> however speaking the truth is not a crime <end>
28 <start> in the letter mr snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the us government to abandon criminal charges against him <end>
20 <start> the charges filed by the us justice department include es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and theft of government property <end>
33 <start> hans @-@ peter friedrich german interior minister told zeit online &quot; if mr snow@@ den is ready to speak to german officials we will find ways to make this possible &quot; <end>
26 <start> relations between the us and germany have come under strain following claims that the n@@ sa bu@@ gged chancellor angela &apos;s merkel &apos;s phone <end>
51 <start> thomas op@@ per@@ mann the mp who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence said that if there were an opportunity to hear mr snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the us &quot; it should be taken <end>
26 <start> mr str√∂@@ bel@@ e an mp for germany &apos;s green party published a picture of himself with mr snow@@ den on his twitter feed <end>
14 <start> he was accompanied on his visit to russia by two german journalists <end>
32 <start> mr str√∂@@ bel@@ e said that according to the former n@@ sa contrac@@ tor &apos;s lawyer mr snow@@ den would not be able to return to russia if he left <end>
25 <start> if mr snow@@ den testi@@ fied in germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there the mp said <end>
28 <start> mr snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home <end>
22 <start> however he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression &quot; <end>
36 <start> citizens around the world as well as high officials including in the united states have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service <end>

12 <start> fron@@ tier airlines to charge for carry @-@ on baggage <end>
23 <start> fron@@ tier airlines plans to charge up to 100 for passengers to store carry @-@ on luggage on board their flight <end>
41 <start> fron@@ tier airlines plans to start charging up to 100 for a carry @-@ on bag and 2 for coffee or so@@ da although its announcement on wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can <end>
26 <start> the new carry @-@ on fee is for bags in the over@@ head bin so small bags under the seat will still be free <end>
28 <start> fron@@ tier said it will charge 25 if the fee is paid in advance 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate <end>
28 <start> fron@@ tier spokes@@ woman k@@ ate o &apos;@@ m@@ alley said the 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance <end>
13 <start> &quot; we don &apos;t want to charge that &quot; she said <end>
14 <start> airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 <end>
41 <start> pas@@ sen@@ gers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into carry @-@ on baggage st@@ ashed in over@@ head b@@ ins meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space <end>
15 <start> fe@@ es are one way to get passengers to bring less on board <end>
16 <start> o &apos;@@ m@@ alley said the new charge is not really about raising money <end>
25 <start> it &apos;s about fron@@ tier &apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head bin space has become increasingly difficult <end>
19 <start> pas@@ sen@@ gers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay <end>
35 <start> that means one passenger in line at a fron@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free while the next person in line might owe 100 for a similar bag <end>
33 <start> o &apos;@@ m@@ alley said fron@@ tier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate <end>
23 <start> fron@@ tier &apos;s new carry @-@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer though a date has@@ n &apos;t been set <end>
19 <start> pas@@ sen@@ gers often g@@ rum@@ ble about baggage charges and other fees but airlines love them <end>
20 <start> they argue that luggage costs money to handle and passengers who want the service should pay for it <end>
32 <start> many on wall street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses <end>
12 <start> most haven &apos;t touched carry @-@ on bag fees though <end>
25 <start> spirit airlines inc. started the first carry @-@ on fee three years ago and fellow dis@@ counter al@@ legi@@ ant air later followed <end>
31 <start> the only other airline with such a fee is hungary &apos;s wiz@@ z air said airline consultant j@@ ay sor@@ en@@ sen who closely tracks add @-@ on fees <end>
22 <start> he estimated in a december 2011 report that spirit &apos;s carry @-@ on fee brings in 50 million a year <end>
37 <start> sor@@ en@@ sen a former executive with mid@@ west airlines fle@@ w spirit recently and wonder@@ ed what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered spirit &apos;s unusual carry @-@ on bag fee <end>
20 <start> &quot; the boarding process was the smooth@@ est i had seen in my airline career &quot; he said <end>
20 <start> i was expecting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate <end>
19 <start> the plane was full he said &quot; and it bo@@ arded li@@ ck@@ ety @-@ split &quot; <end>
18 <start> fron@@ tier is also following spirit &apos;s 2 charge for coffee tea so@@ da or juice <end>
26 <start> fron@@ tier said passengers who get so@@ da or juice can keep the whole can and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free <end>
8 <start> it will still give away water <end>
27 <start> us airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers compla@@ ined and no other major airline followed <end>
34 <start> fron@@ tier &apos;s move to charge the carry @-@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website <end>
20 <start> airlines pay online travel s@@ ellers such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 for each ticket sold <end>
26 <start> that has given all airlines an incentive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency <end>
14 <start> fron@@ tier has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area though <end>
23 <start> in september it began giving half as many frequent fli@@ er miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency <end>
21 <start> on wednesday it s@@ las@@ hed the mile@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip <end>
19 <start> so a 1,000 mile fron@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles <end>
22 <start> it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the fron@@ tier website <end>
27 <start> fron@@ tier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of den@@ ver but its business is shr@@ in@@ king and losing money <end>
34 <start> re@@ venue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shr@@ ank almost 13 percent in the first quarter according to financial results released wednesday by corporate parent republic airways hol@@ dings inc <end>
18 <start> republic has been trying to fix fron@@ tier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline <end>

40 <start> canadian plane and train maker bombar@@ dier inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on thursday pres@@ su@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit <end>
44 <start> montreal @-@ based bombar@@ dier also did not release any flight test data for its brand @-@ new c@@ series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next september <end>

30 <start> &quot; while the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation &quot; do@@ erk@@ sen said in a client note <end>
22 <start> we believe that bombar@@ dier will receive new orders for the c@@ series as the flight test program progres@@ ses <end>
26 <start> however if no new orders are announced in the coming months we suspect that the market will become more skep@@ tical of the program <end>
28 <start> bombar@@ dier hopes the c@@ series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the low end of a market now dominated by boeing and airbus <end>
25 <start> the first test plane was un@@ vei@@ led in march and took flight for the first time in september after months of delays <end>
43 <start> but firm orders for the c@@ series are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the company &apos;s claims about the new jet@@ liner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential <end>

23 <start> we had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done <end>

26 <start> the second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks with the remainder following shortly after the company said <end>

31 <start> in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business <end>

8 <start> town council delighted with solid budget <end>

28 <start> the municipality coff@@ ers in her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen @-@ sch√∂n@@ ach are well sto@@ cked and the administration has been debt @-@ free since 2005 <end>
18 <start> in this sense this the 2012 budgetary year can also be recorded as a complete success <end>
13 <start> this became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 <end>
28 <start> as andrea roth@@ mund explained the administrative budget came in at more than eur one million higher than originally planned at around 7.@@ 6 million euro <end>
22 <start> the administrative budget surplus at around eur 1.@@ 8 million also stood at around eur one million above projec@@ tions <end>
21 <start> the surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax <end>
12 <start> the capital budget also stood well above the projected values <end>
19 <start> instead of the projected eur 1.5 million euro the value for last year was eur 2.5 million <end>
19 <start> &quot; this is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget &quot; said roth@@ mund <end>
20 <start> because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned the reserves also came in higher <end>
26 <start> in total they managed to increase the general contin@@ gency reserves by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million <end>
18 <start> mayor ral@@ ph ger@@ ster than@@ ked roth@@ mund and its team for the good work <end>
24 <start> &quot; a job like this is not something you achieve overnight &quot; said ger@@ ster in praise of the annual financial statement <end>
17 <start> he and the town coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors are clearly delighted with the good figures <end>
24 <start> it may sound like a paradox but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens <end>
21 <start> in the past a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates <end>
21 <start> however according to ger@@ ster from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state <end>
20 <start> there are prerequi@@ sites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements <end>
19 <start> among other requirements the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must lev@@ y certain municipal rates <end>
37 <start> &quot; we have to address the subject of municipal rates as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies &quot; commented ger@@ ster regarding this matter <end>

30 <start> &quot; i am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals sd@@ gs &quot; he said <end>
29 <start> these sd@@ gs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals and they will be an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 development framework <end>
34 <start> i will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the md@@ gs <end>
30 <start> even though the s@@ g ach@@ im baden has gone four match days without victory a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight hand@@ ball team <end>

12 <start> everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand <end>

32 <start> even though the third @-@ tier reserves from fre@@ den@@ beck are no &apos;t exactly in the best form at the moment mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance <end>
14 <start> i trained many of the players myself in the a @-@ youth <end>
13 <start> consequently they will be particularly motivated playing against their former coach <end>
29 <start> &quot; in addition we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ for@@ cements from the first team will be there &quot; explained the s@@ g coach <end>
27 <start> in any case if they are to finally get back on the winning track mal@@ mon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances <end>
15 <start> there have been major problems primarily in terms of covering and counter attacking <end>
13 <start> the team &apos;s eye for the goal must be considerably improved <end>
19 <start> therefore i hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break <end>

54 <start> mr gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told afp the french news agency on wednesday that mr d@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions &quot; <end>
15 <start> both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ amo insist they want to avoid war <end>
25 <start> but concerns have grown after mr ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga was quoted as saying ren@@ amo was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace accord <end>
20 <start> he told the ft that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by fre@@ lim@@ o <end>
21 <start> &quot; our vision is to come back to negotiations but with seriousness &quot; mr ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said <end>

12 <start> presiden@@ tial and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year <end>
29 <start> some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government <end>
45 <start> ren@@ amo &apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992 while a newer party the democratic movement of moz@@ ambi@@ que md@@ m which was formed by a former ren@@ amo member is expected to improve its showing at the elections <end>

38 <start> &quot; he does not want multi @-@ party democracy he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &quot; mr ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said <end>
36 <start> it is unclear how much capacity ren@@ amo has but it has carried out disrup@@ tive hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north @-@ south highway <end>

12 <start> the appeals court heard arguments tuesday on the requested stay <end>

42 <start> &quot; we want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible &quot; said mayor j@@ ens h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen <end>
27 <start> around 80 participants came to the gemeinde@@ halle community hall to have the planned measures explained to them to express their concerns and submit ideas <end>
22 <start> h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler made clear &quot; the final decisions will be made by the members of the town council &quot; <end>
34 <start> h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler commented that the flood that found ge@@ ch@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 may 2009 was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future <end>
32 <start> a river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of a@@ id@@ lingen which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen <end>
23 <start> &quot; the goal is the protection of as many developed pl@@ ots of land as possible &quot; said h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler <end>
29 <start> the basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods which statisti@@ cally occurs every 100 years according to the german we@@ ather service <end>
18 <start> climate change is taken into account in the form of an allowance of 15 per cent <end>
17 <start> in expert circles this is referred to as &quot; h@@ q 100@@ a@@ klima &quot; <end>
24 <start> the masses of water that caused considerable damage in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000 @-@ year flood <end>
25 <start> &quot; there is no such thing as absolute protection but we can attempt to make a relative improvement &quot; said h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler <end>
37 <start> in order to achieve h@@ q 100@@ a@@ klima protection around four million ‚Ç¨ must be invested in ge@@ ch@@ ingen whereby the town can count on a state subsidy of around 70 per cent <end>
20 <start> however h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed <end>
20 <start> in order to develop such a concept the town is reli@@ ant on the cooperation of its citizens <end>
11 <start> a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed <end>
12 <start> in a best case scenario implementation could begin in 2016 <end>
42 <start> among other measures the protection concept which we reported has already been presented to the town council during the past week plans local measures in the tri@@ but@@ ary to the river ir@@ m running from the stamm@@ heim valley <end>
23 <start> in conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns <end>
27 <start> among others the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and detention reser@@ vo@@ irs are no longer planned to protect the location <end>
51 <start> greg@@ or k√ºh@@ n technical plann@@ er at the commissioned engineering company h√º@@ gel@@ sh@@ eim @-@ based &apos; wald und cor@@ be &apos; who presented the concept emphasised that it required the inter@@ play of all proposed measures in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal <end>
18 <start> furthermore the most economic solution must be found said joachim wald of wald und cor@@ be <end>
37 <start> there was res@@ ent@@ ment among local residents of the old town who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ flowing of the canal network even during normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms <end>
17 <start> the problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken <end>
26 <start> however h@@ √§u√ü@@ ler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection and these must not be confused <end>
29 <start> the town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can with@@ stand ra@@ inf@@ all events every two to three years <end>

22 <start> the cd@@ c found the preval@@ ence of food all@@ ergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 <end>
35 <start> the guide contains information for schools on how to make fac@@ ulty and staff aware of children &apos;s food all@@ ergies and how to handle them should an all@@ ergi@@ c reaction occur <end>

21 <start> germany became the first european nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a <end>
16 <start> no longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female <end>
34 <start> the new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates <end>
39 <start> the aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make ha@@ sty decisions on sex @-@ assignment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex <end>
23 <start> one inter@@ sex person according to the bbc said years later &quot; i am neither a man nor a woman &quot; <end>

53 <start> gender identification is still not well understood but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery if at all <end>
32 <start> new york city psychi@@ at@@ rist dr. jack dre@@ scher who speciali@@ zes in issues of gender identification said the new german law &quot; sounds like a good thing &quot; <end>
8 <start> inter@@ sex children pose ethical dilemma <end>
23 <start> &quot; some people have life @-@ end@@ an@@ gering conditions that require surgery but most kids do not &quot; he said <end>
16 <start> you can make a gender assignment without surgery and then see how identity develops <end>
18 <start> the science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate <end>
11 <start> nobody can answer the questions about why this happens <end>
13 <start> it &apos;s like the myst@@ ery of why people are gay <end>
61 <start> a report filed to the european commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological mak@@ eu@@ p which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either <end>
44 <start> these features can mani@@ fest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass hair distribution bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ itali@@ a or in chro@@ mo@@ som@@ al structures and hormon@@ es <end>

19 <start> in neighbor@@ ing france gender issues are still controversial according to a news report on france 24 <end>
29 <start> in 2011 dozens of french law@@ makers from that strongly catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school text@@ books <end>
45 <start> the u.s. website catholic online has also opposed the german law writing that &quot; as the world is being dra@@ gged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not we reverse two more pillars of civilization &quot; <end>
25 <start> one mar@@ yland mother of a new@@ born also told the baby zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth <end>
31 <start> &quot; par@@ enting is stres@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limitations especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child &quot; she told the par@@ enting website <end>
7 <start> children need stability and certainty <end>
34 <start> histor@@ ically children born with both male and female gen@@ itali@@ a were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes named for the hand@@ some greek god who had dual sexu@@ ality <end>
28 <start> and as little as a decade ago the medical community thought of gender as a s@@ late that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn <end>
40 <start> but now many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery knowing that gender identity is complex and doctors can sometimes get it wrong not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up <end>
25 <start> &quot; back in the middle of the 20th century it was called a &apos; psychi@@ atri@@ c emergency &apos; &quot; said dre@@ scher <end>
21 <start> when these kids were born you didn &apos;t call the psychi@@ at@@ rist you called a sur@@ ge@@ on <end>
36 <start> the prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a was put forward by dr. john money at joh@@ ns hop@@ kins university who held that gender was m@@ alle@@ able <end>
46 <start> he co@@ ined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hormon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female <end>
18 <start> but in one 1966 case known as &quot; john jo@@ an &quot; his theories became controversial <end>
45 <start> he advised the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to have the child fully ca@@ str@@ ated removing his tes@@ tic@@ les as well and to raise him as a girl <end>
21 <start> &quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition but it was not &quot; said dre@@ scher <end>
19 <start> when the boy was around 15 he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman <end>
8 <start> but at 38 he committed suicide <end>
17 <start> dre@@ scher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model &quot; <end>
31 <start> but in the 1990s with the adv@@ ent of the internet survi@@ vors of these gender sur@@ ger@@ ies have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome &quot; <end>
36 <start> such was the case with jim bru@@ ce a 36 @-@ year @-@ old writer from mon@@ tana who was born with x@@ y male chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but ambiguous gen@@ it@@ als <end>
36 <start> doc@@ tors couldn &apos;t be sure if he had a large cli@@ tor@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man <end>
29 <start> so shortly after his birth in 1976 bru@@ ce &apos;s external organ and te@@ stes were sur@@ gi@@ cally removed and he was raised as a girl <end>
11 <start> he was given female hormon@@ es at age 12 <end>
18 <start> &quot; i knew that i wasn &apos;t a girl &quot; he told ab@@ c@@ new@@ s.com <end>
14 <start> i was un@@ happy but it was really difficult to ask questions <end>
15 <start> at 18 he was set for a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ la@@ sty <end>
14 <start> but de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong he demanded medical records <end>
9 <start> what he found out was horri@@ fying <end>
15 <start> i was sterili@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me <end>
28 <start> bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d that prevented his body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als <end>
24 <start> after learning the truth he changed back to a man taking te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one shots and having his bre@@ asts removed <end>
8 <start> sur@@ gery rendered him in@@ fertile <end>
26 <start> today he advocates for others in an organization called the interface project trying to normali@@ ze percep@@ tions of those who are inter@@ sex <end>
38 <start> but anne tam@@ ar @-@ mat@@ tis executive director for california @-@ based legal group ad@@ voc@@ ates for inform@@ ed cho@@ ice worries that the german law &quot; invites lab@@ eling and sti@@ gma &quot; <end>
35 <start> &quot; a lot of activists are concerned that what the german rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined &apos; &quot; she said <end>
9 <start> we are afraid it will encourage intervention <end>
16 <start> we think a better process is as@@ signing male or female sex then waiting <end>
21 <start> but we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out so all we can do is spec@@ ulate <end>
30 <start> tam@@ ar @-@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender &quot; <end>
20 <start> &quot; ad@@ ul@@ ts should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender &quot; she said <end>
11 <start> german law is about as@@ signing it at birth <end>
17 <start> that is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point <end>
14 <start> when they are grown they can make decisions about their own bodies <end>
48 <start> but dr. ar@@ l@@ ene bar@@ atz a pit@@ ts@@ burgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group said the german law will &quot; em@@ power &quot; both parents and children <end>

21 <start> though she is in@@ fertile she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational sur@@ rog@@ acy <end>
22 <start> &quot; the law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves &quot; said bar@@ atz <end>
30 <start> it gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; <end>
14 <start> this way you are ok -- raise the child love the child <end>
11 <start> you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun <end>
15 <start> we don &apos;t have to rush into surgery that is irre@@ ver@@ sible <end>
33 <start> &quot; it brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing &quot; she said <end>
23 <start> ultimately the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing <end>

24 <start> the as@@ sail@@ ants fired on a group of children on thursday evening in gen@@ thin presum@@ ably with an air gun <end>
10 <start> this was announced by the police in burg <end>
12 <start> the girl suffered minor injury to her left cal@@ f <end>
12 <start> res@@ cu@@ e workers took the girl to the hospital <end>
21 <start> the shots came from a small car which dro@@ ve past a group of six children and suddenly stopped <end>
11 <start> wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car <end>
13 <start> the as@@ sail@@ ants also fired shots at a bus stop <end>
10 <start> a pan@@ e of glass was sh@@ attered <end>
7 <start> they then dro@@ ve away <end>
18 <start> the criminal inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation department is investigating the matter it was stated on friday <end>
19 <start> thus far the kemp@@ ten police department can look back on a calm h@@ allo@@ ween night <end>
18 <start> the authorities were only called out twice to deal with children thro@@ wing eggs against houses <end>
26 <start> because the home owners realised this immediately the egg rem@@ n@@ ants could be cleaned off at once meaning that no material damage occurred <end>
23 <start> furthermore in the town centre area while a few fire@@ works were set off no material damage was caused here either <end>
30 <start> the residents of the bisch@@ of @-@ freund@@ or@@ fer @-@ weg reported that a car was wra@@ pped in toilet paper and its wheel tri@@ ms stolen <end>
27 <start> however the man found all his wheel tri@@ ms nearby prior to the police arriving on account of which no further police involvement was required <end>

17 <start> if truth be told wal@@ trau@@ d r@@ ies lives a dre@@ am@@ y life <end>
28 <start> her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in stuttgart with plenty of green@@ ery an old tree population nice neighbours and not too much traffic <end>
15 <start> she is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport <end>
29 <start> &quot; hop@@ efully you aren &apos;t afraid of spi@@ ders &quot; asks wal@@ trau@@ d r@@ ies pointing out a large spi@@ der on the door frame <end>
19 <start> i have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now <end>
11 <start> but you know how difficult that is in stuttgart <end>
46 <start> however the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ bia but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house and inside their home in their old age she explained <end>
36 <start> furthermore since undergoing a men@@ is@@ cus operation the lady in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability <end>
29 <start> only recently she released a book on the subject of &quot; living happ@@ ily in old age which type of property is the best for me &quot; <end>
26 <start> &quot; our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age &quot; she begins to re@@ count <end>
26 <start> when she moved to the ma@@ ison@@ ette with her husband 20 years ago it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings <end>
19 <start> now in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties wal@@ trau@@ d r@@ ies has different thoughts about it <end>
27 <start> however she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; <end>
19 <start> the majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible <end>
12 <start> only other people get old she says sm@@ ir@@ king <end>
14 <start> only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consideration <end>
16 <start> &quot; but at this stage it can be too late &quot; said r@@ ies <end>
19 <start> in her book the interior decor@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age <end>
18 <start> &quot; however which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision &quot; she explains <end>
10 <start> there is no solution to overcoming old age <end>
30 <start> even if you can afford to spend your retirement in tuscany or b@@ ritt@@ any you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration <end>
39 <start> and &apos; without a sound knowledge of the local language you can even become lon@@ ely when living the dol@@ ce v@@ ita &apos; added the author providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad <end>
20 <start> her models include classic care models alternative living arrangements and the often @-@ mentioned pensioners &apos; living community <end>
14 <start> in old age everyone has their qu@@ ir@@ ks and ti@@ cks <end>
21 <start> &apos;@@ however this type of residential community would not be for me &apos; she commented with a w@@ ink <end>
14 <start> defin@@ itely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen <end>
19 <start> &apos;@@ in old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to &apos; said r@@ ies <end>
21 <start> however the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners &apos; residential community can work <end>
13 <start> however it must operate differently to the classic student di@@ gs <end>
15 <start> and sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet &apos; she believes <end>
15 <start> with this opinion she is at least not alone in the state capital <end>
47 <start> the experience of ther@@ esa r√º@@ tten head of the citizen &apos;s life in old age service in the state capital is also that &apos; the majority of old people in stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; <end>
16 <start> her agency agency adv@@ ises people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; <end>
37 <start> therefore the experience of the stiftung war@@ ent@@ est consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveni@@ ences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment <end>
23 <start> nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier @-@ free <end>
40 <start> r@@ ies recommends that all those working on the age @-@ appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in @-@ depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first tra@@ des@@ man that comes along <end>
15 <start> nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly <end>
38 <start> even in the case of rental apartments some land@@ l@@ ords can have this work carried out even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat clarified the interior designer <end>
32 <start> however it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age @-@ appropriate and therefore barrier @-@ free even if it is as beautiful as ever <end>
14 <start> wal@@ trau@@ d r@@ ies had to go through this experience herself <end>
40 <start> you could of course install a sta@@ ir lift inside the apartment but the co@@ bb@@ led path up to the door of the apartment featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hin@@ d@@ rance <end>
18 <start> she will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband <end>
18 <start> she is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front door <end>
11 <start> the usa still want to prosec@@ ute snow@@ den <end>
20 <start> the usa have not changed their position regarding the former us sec@@ ret service employee edward snow@@ den <end>
13 <start> he is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation <end>
28 <start> he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the usa said the spokes@@ person for the us foreign office j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki in washington <end>
15 <start> even the most recent statements from snow@@ den will not change this fact <end>
34 <start> following a recent meeting with snow@@ den in moscow german green party politician hans @-@ christian str√∂@@ bel@@ e appe@@ aled to the usa not to continue to threaten him with prosecution <end>
27 <start> p@@ sa@@ ki emphasised that str√∂@@ bel@@ e &apos;s comments were the views of a parliament@@ arian and not those of a german government member <end>
25 <start> sec@@ ret service whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer edward snow@@ den is in principle willing to hold a discussion with the german authorities <end>
12 <start> however he first wishes for his situation to be clarified <end>
58 <start> this was made clear by the former n@@ sa employee currently sought by the usa in an open letter that green party politician hans @-@ christian str√∂@@ bel@@ e made public on friday following a meeting with snow@@ den and passed on to the federal government the federal parliament and the federal public prosec@@ utor general <end>
14 <start> the letter was pur@@ ported to have been wor@@ ded as follows <end>
7 <start> to whom it may concern <end>
16 <start> i have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance <end>
30 <start> i am edward joseph snow@@ den formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the united states national security agency and defense intelligence agency <end>
29 <start> in the course of my service to these organizations i believe i witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act <end>
27 <start> as a result of reporting these concerns i have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home <end>
24 <start> i am currently living in ex@@ ile under a grant of temporary asylum in the russian federation in accordance with international law <end>
22 <start> i am hear@@ tened by the response to my act of political expression in both the united states and beyond <end>
36 <start> citizens around the world as well as high officials including in the united states have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service <end>
28 <start> these sp@@ ying revel@@ ations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly conce@@ aled abuses of the public trust <end>
29 <start> the benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitig@@ ated <end>
39 <start> though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence <end>
10 <start> however speaking the truth is not a crime <end>
24 <start> i am confident that with the support of the international community the government of the united states will abandon this harmful behaviour <end>
51 <start> i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved i will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media particularly with regard to the truth and authentic@@ ity of documents as appropriate and in accordance with the law <end>
33 <start> i look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts in uphol@@ ding the international laws that protect us all <end>

11 <start> eur 100,000 have been added to the local budget <end>
17 <start> it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kinder@@ garten <end>
53 <start> the mayor considers it the right decision that winter@@ lingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus will no longer have to pay for the up@@ keep of the building such as heating it tending to the garden and clearing the pav@@ ement <end>

32 <start> president barack obama &apos;s closest advis@@ ers secre@@ tly considered replacing vice president joe bi@@ den with h@@ illary clinton on the 2012 ticket according to the new york times <end>
36 <start> the revel@@ ation is the most notable bom@@ b@@ shell from mark hal@@ per@@ in and john hei@@ le@@ mann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tom@@ e &quot; double down game change 2012 &quot; <end>
54 <start> the times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported thursday evening that the president &apos;s top ai@@ des conducted &quot; extensive group @-@ sessions and poll@@ ing in late 2011 &quot; to gauge whether the dumping bi@@ den could help bol@@ ster obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re @-@ election hopes <end>
62 <start> according to the times &apos; national political correspon@@ dent jonathan martin the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the white house namely former white house chief of staff bill dal@@ ey to measure what effect sw@@ apping former secretary of state clinton for the vice president would have in the polls <end>
22 <start> the potential switch was a closely gu@@ arded secret within the chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the o@@ val office <end>
48 <start> only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advis@@ ers -- including dal@@ ey former obama campaign chief jim mess@@ ina and former white house senior advis@@ ers david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d and david pl@@ ou@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration <end>
51 <start> &quot; double down &quot; claims dal@@ ey sp@@ ear@@ headed the effort to replace bi@@ den despite their &quot; close personal rap@@ port &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding clinton to the ticket wouldn &apos;t &quot; materi@@ ally improve obama &apos;s odds &quot; <end>
22 <start> in an interview with martin dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing bi@@ den with clinton <end>
27 <start> &quot; i was vocal about looking into a whole b@@ unch of things and this was one of them &quot; dal@@ ey told the paper <end>
28 <start> you have to remember at that point the president was in aw@@ ful shape so we were like &quot; holy christ what do we do &quot; <end>
48 <start> while dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due di@@ li@@ gence &quot; martin told cn@@ n &apos;s ander@@ son co@@ oper that the re @-@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay divi@@ den@@ ds at the polls <end>
32 <start> &quot; camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s don &apos;t spend the kind of money on poll@@ ing and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something &quot; martin said on ac@@ 360 <end>
15 <start> it &apos;s unclear however whether obama knew his team was exploring the swap <end>
25 <start> martin told cn@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey whether his then @-@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le <end>
34 <start> while dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the president &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; obama knew <end>
23 <start> martin added that &quot; double down &quot; does not definiti@@ vely answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached obama &apos;s desk <end>
24 <start> co@@ oper asked martin whether he seriously thought obama did not know about the research into dumping bi@@ den from the ticket <end>
9 <start> &quot; po@@ ssi@@ bly &quot; martin replied <end>
12 <start> what happens with my e @-@ mail when in transit <end>
10 <start> e @-@ mail is short for electronic mail <end>
29 <start> are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence similar to that of the traditional postal service implemented into the design of this internet @-@ based service <end>
15 <start> when designing the early internet services the focus lay on making communication possible <end>
28 <start> thus when developing the underlying technical protocols no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the inter@@ c@@ eption @-@ proof exchange of mail <end>
19 <start> for this reason a traditional email is more like an open post@@ card than a sealed letter <end>
24 <start> when user &quot; anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; b@@ enn@@ i &quot; are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected <end>
19 <start> anna &apos;s email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server <end>
15 <start> if she has a g@@ mail account for example this would be google <end>
16 <start> this mail server sends the content to the provider that b@@ enn@@ i uses <end>
17 <start> en route the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the internet <end>
14 <start> b@@ enn@@ i can then call up the content from his provider <end>
17 <start> are traditional e @-@ mails read by third parties on their journey through the net <end>
20 <start> the majority of e @-@ mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient <end>
23 <start> ch@@ ecks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment <end>
13 <start> a virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems <end>
29 <start> in addition the providers check whether it is nu@@ is@@ ance or unwanted spam mail which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder <end>
8 <start> do the robots have other tasks <end>
26 <start> in the case of systems such as g@@ mail the robots also identify the information that google requires for displaying context @-@ based advertising <end>
25 <start> if anna and b@@ enn@@ i communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via g@@ mail google can display corresponding links to holiday offers <end>
11 <start> do unknown individuals also read the e @-@ mails <end>
14 <start> the probability of un@@ authorised persons reading a mail is extremely low <end>
8 <start> however theore@@ tically it is possible <end>
15 <start> within companies administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent <end>
24 <start> law enforcement authorities and sec@@ ret services also have legal authorisation to inter@@ c@@ ept or take note of e @-@ mails <end>
10 <start> this may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities <end>
13 <start> is it possible to protect e @-@ mails against being read <end>
22 <start> with an encryption using the open@@ p@@ gp standard an e @-@ mail can be effectively protected against being read <end>
34 <start> with great technical effort it is also possible to conce@@ al the met@@ ad@@ ata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom <end>
16 <start> how important are yahoo and google within the e @-@ mail market in germany <end>
31 <start> according to a study conducted by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 among the main mail services in private use yahoo and google play only a minor role <end>
20 <start> while the number of yahoo mail accounts has fallen recently google &apos;s g@@ mail managed to grow considerably <end>
12 <start> mother buried in sh@@ allow forest grave and pension stolen <end>
16 <start> when his elderly mother died a man from wol@@ fs@@ burg devised a plan <end>
20 <start> he buried the dec@@ e@@ ased in a forest and continued to collect her pension and care allowance <end>
36 <start> according to police investigations a 67 @-@ year @-@ old wol@@ fs@@ burg resident buried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allowance <end>
30 <start> he first covered up the death of the 89 @-@ year @-@ old and then po@@ ck@@ eted the money for more than a year and a half <end>
20 <start> the 67 @-@ year @-@ old must now face charges of fraud said a spokes@@ person on friday <end>
20 <start> according to the statement the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ st@@ edt <end>
32 <start> the man was already under suspicion back in may at that time the fact that medic@@ ations for his care @-@ reli@@ ant mother were no longer required drew suspicion <end>
15 <start> the pension@@ er told investig@@ ators that his mother had travelled to spain <end>
12 <start> the officials found this strange and so continued to investigate <end>
33 <start> it was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had c@@ ared for her in her final days <end>
15 <start> the 67 @-@ year @-@ old finally acknowledged the death of his mother <end>

15 <start> fan@@ cy a g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream <end>
27 <start> a british entrepren@@ eur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish <end>
25 <start> charlie francis has har@@ ness@@ ed the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the lumin@@ es@@ cent snack <end>
32 <start> he came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in china to chem@@ ically recre@@ ate the g@@ lowing protein <end>
26 <start> the ice cream re@@ acts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue raising the p@@ h level in the protein and making it g@@ low <end>
31 <start> chris says because the ice cream lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick the bri@@ ghter it becomes <end>
46 <start> charlie founder of the &quot; l@@ ick me i &apos;m deli@@ cious &quot; ice cream company said &quot; it is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production so ¬£ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff &quot; <end>
20 <start> the protein we are using in the ice cream re@@ acts with your tongue at neutral p@@ h <end>
25 <start> so as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the p@@ h level and the ice cream will g@@ low <end>
32 <start> we have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over h@@ allo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect <end>
29 <start> it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish lumin@@ esc@@ ence is four times more expensive than gold <end>
11 <start> so each sco@@ op costs me around ¬£ 140 <end>
7 <start> it tastes pretty good though <end>
24 <start> charlie &apos;s experimental company based in bristol is fam@@ ed for its unusual flavours including beer cheese beef and gold lea@@ f <end>
13 <start> but his next creation is set to be even more ambitious <end>
15 <start> he said &quot; i really want to develop an invisible ice cream &quot; <end>
36 <start> it is inher@@ ently impossible because of the refra@@ ction caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cream but i reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it <end>
25 <start> the ice cream har@@ nesses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish syn@@ the@@ sized by chinese scientists <end>

13 <start> like us da@@ ver@@ den place emphasis on high tempo play <end>
13 <start> for this reason we must keep our errors to a minimum <end>

35 <start> and one that is so long in the to@@ oth it has become fossi@@ li@@ sed i first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago <end>
20 <start> yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a whis@@ ker@@ y old tale <end>
16 <start> why should an independent scotland be expected to do europe &apos;s bi@@ dding anyway <end>
14 <start> why trade london &apos;s yo@@ ke for that of brussels especially now <end>
21 <start> here is the real european news the great post @-@ war plan to unite europe has finally st@@ alled <end>
11 <start> with the euro crisis project europe is officially dead <end>
26 <start> across the eu parties which are dedicated to opposing the eu or to scra@@ pping the euro as a common currency are gaining ground <end>
53 <start> even in germany the euro@@ scep@@ tic alternative for germany party founded only this year came from nowhere to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in september &apos;s federal elections thus effectively kno@@ cking the free democrats equivalent to our own li@@ b d@@ ems out of the bun@@ de@@ stag <end>
16 <start> there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe <end>
12 <start> however the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed <end>
41 <start> the austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank coupled with the stra@@ it@@ jacket imposed on national economies through adher@@ ence to the common currency has led many people to think project europe has gone too far <end>
24 <start> the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits that was true only of greece <end>
24 <start> rather the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to german expor@@ ters something german politicians want to keep <end>
27 <start> without the possibility of domestic currency de@@ valuation southern europe finds itself with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ √† @-@ vis germany <end>
18 <start> the only recourse is to s@@ lash wages and public spending sp@@ urred on by berlin <end>
16 <start> beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper european productivity mal@@ aise <end>
49 <start> as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by brussels code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing french and german energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense european industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the united states <end>
19 <start> that is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost disadvantage as we &apos;ve already seen at gran@@ gem@@ outh <end>
28 <start> all the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the european petro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap us sh@@ ale gas <end>
21 <start> as a result revol@@ t is bre@@ wing especially in france once the eu &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader <end>
32 <start> after the war the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to keep germany in check and to give paris equal b@@ illing in the world with washington <end>
30 <start> but berlin no longer needs paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on europe leaving the bat@@ tered french economy struggling <end>
32 <start> resul@@ t marine le pen &apos;s right @-@ wing anti @-@ eu national front has just won a crucial by @-@ election kno@@ cking the ruling socialists into third place <end>
40 <start> the front is now the most popular party in france with 24 per cent of the vote a timely warning to british labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left <end>
18 <start> what is le pen doing with her new@@ found popularity among the french white working class <end>
26 <start> she wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti @-@ eu anti @-@ common currency bloc across the european parliament <end>
28 <start> if as is very possible anti @-@ eu parties do well in these elections such a bloc could dominate the european parliament for the first time <end>
30 <start> here &apos;s my point some@@ time soon growing anti @-@ eu and anti @-@ common currency feeling in europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro <end>
32 <start> the eu won &apos;t disappear but it will rever@@ t to something more like the loose &quot; europe of the so@@ vereig@@ n nations &quot; favoured by general de gaulle <end>
25 <start> germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but france and southern europe will revi@@ ve their own currencies <end>
19 <start> i expect the uk will distance itself from this project hoping to cosy up to the us <end>
20 <start> however washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific suggests britain will be left out in the atlantic cold <end>
7 <start> where does this leave scotland <end>
13 <start> we can choose to be a region of essentially little england <end>
20 <start> or we can defend our own economic interests which includes telling berlin and brussels where to get off <end>
21 <start> i suspect that scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser european arrangement provided we kept our own currency <end>
23 <start> co @-@ operation with other like @-@ minded countries will be easier in a non @-@ federal europe of the nations <end>
15 <start> otherwise we should consider em@@ ul@@ ating norway and retaining our economic independence <end>
61 <start> the sn@@ p government in scotland is remark@@ ab@@ ly@@ -- the most successful anti @-@ austerity political movement in europe having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed and implemented by labour &apos;s chan@@ cell@@ or ali@@ sta@@ ir dar@@ ling and the subsequent t@@ ory @-@ li@@ b dem coalition <end>

17 <start> time is the most accurate test of how pu@@ ber@@ ty is going to progress <end>

22 <start> there are lots of well @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed theories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ cious pu@@ ber@@ ty <end>

49 <start> the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long @-@ haul flights for economy passengers not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by airbus sas and boeing co <end>
43 <start> airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches 46 cm wide in economy cab@@ ins but its u.s. arch @-@ rival boeing says it should be for airlines to decide <end>
37 <start> the dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever @-@ larger versions of their twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ distance aircraft with potentially record orders expected at the november 17 @-@ 21 event <end>
41 <start> how the back of the plane is laid out particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini @-@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; jet designs <end>
36 <start> boeing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x &quot; will hold 4@@ 06 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row <end>

51 <start> between the early 1970s when the boeing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o defined modern long @-@ haul travel and the turn of the century the weight of the average american 40@@ to 49 @-@ year @-@ old male increased by 10 per cent according to u.s. health department data <end>

22 <start> airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent <end>
30 <start> boeing disputes airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fa@@ res and facilities <end>
18 <start> it also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat <end>
39 <start> &quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful &quot; said boeing cab@@ ins expert k@@ ent cra@@ ver <end>

17 <start> new anti @-@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could take the pleasure out of smoking <end>
24 <start> scienti@@ sts have developed an anti @-@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette <end>
22 <start> a single dose of the vacc@@ ine was able to protect mi@@ ce against nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction for life <end>
35 <start> further tests are needed before starting human trials which would take several years but professor ronald crystal of wei@@ ll corn@@ ell medical college in new york said the early signs are good <end>
59 <start> &quot; we are very hop@@ eful that this kind of vacc@@ ine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today but find their nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches &quot; pro@@ f corn@@ ell said <end>
30 <start> the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti @-@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies <end>
23 <start> the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects li@@ ver cells which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies <end>
38 <start> the anti@@ bodies h@@ unt down any nic@@ ot@@ ine molec@@ ules in the bloo@@ d@@ stream neutrali@@ sing them before they reached the brain preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a nic@@ ot@@ ine hit <end>
20 <start> in tests vacc@@ inated mi@@ ce who were subsequently given nic@@ ot@@ ine continued with their normal activity <end>
33 <start> but mi@@ ce who had not been given the vacc@@ ine &quot; ch@@ illed out &quot; say the researchers a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins <end>
14 <start> the experiments are described in the journal science trans@@ l@@ ational medicine <end>
12 <start> pre@@ vious tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies <end>
28 <start> the j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels t@@ opp@@ ed up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical <end>
26 <start> but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be far lower because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body factories <end>
36 <start> pro@@ f crystal said that if a future human vacc@@ ine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a cigarette preventing nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction <end>
15 <start> but more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to qu@@ it <end>

49 <start> air@@ line passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate @-@ to @-@ gate to read work play games watch movies and listen to music but not talk on their cell@@ phones under much @-@ anticipated new guidelines issued thursday by the federal aviation administration <end>
12 <start> but passengers sh@@ ouldn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately <end>
25 <start> how fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline fa@@ a administrator michael hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference <end>
40 <start> airlines will have to show the fa@@ a how their air@@ planes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manu@@ als and rules for sto@@ wing devices to reflect the new guidelines <end>
24 <start> the fa@@ a said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes <end>
17 <start> delta and jet@@ blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans <end>
28 <start> &quot; depending on the condition of the plan we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon &quot; the fa@@ a said in a statement <end>
25 <start> currently passengers are required to turn off their sm@@ art@@ phones tab@@ lets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door clo@@ ses <end>
23 <start> they &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go @-@ ahead <end>
31 <start> pas@@ sen@@ gers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground <end>
36 <start> under the new guidelines airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during take@@ off@@ s land@@ ings and ta@@ xi@@ ing the fa@@ a said <end>
31 <start> most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use wi@@ fi at higher al@@ titudes are expected to meet the criteria <end>
21 <start> lau@@ ra gl@@ ading president of the association of professional f@@ light at@@ ten@@ dan@@ ts welcomed the changes <end>
37 <start> &quot; once the new policy is safely implemented and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that it will be a win @-@ win &quot; gl@@ ading said in a statement <end>
19 <start> we &apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; when it comes to this issue <end>
25 <start> but connecting to the internet to surf exchange emails text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet the agency said <end>
23 <start> pas@@ sen@@ gers will be told to switch their sm@@ art@@ phones tab@@ lets and other devices to air@@ plane mode <end>
62 <start> so still no wor@@ ds with friends the online s@@ cra@@ b@@ ble @-@ type game that actor ale@@ c bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his sm@@ art@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously bo@@ oted off an american airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate <end>
33 <start> and heavi@@ er devices such as lap@@ tops will continue to have to be sto@@ wed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cabin <end>
14 <start> in @-@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited <end>
18 <start> regul@@ atory authority over phone calls belongs to the federal communications commission not the fa@@ a <end>
16 <start> fa@@ a may lift ban on some electronic devices during take@@ off and landing <end>
29 <start> last month national transpor@@ tation safety board mark rosen@@ ker a c@@ bs news national transportation safety expert said that cell phones are still considered a risk <end>
50 <start> &quot; c@@ ell phones that really is an issue not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices but we do know according to the f@@ cc that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they &apos;re in the air &quot; rosen@@ ker said <end>
28 <start> an industry advisory committee created by the fa@@ a to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices <end>
20 <start> pres@@ sure has been building on the fa@@ a in recent years to ease restrictions on their use <end>
27 <start> cri@@ tics such as sen@@ cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ kill d @-@ mo cont@@ end there is no valid safety reason for the prohi@@ bitions <end>
21 <start> the restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubi@@ quit@@ ous <end>
21 <start> some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices <end>
43 <start> the fa@@ a began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying fm radi@@ os the high @-@ tech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day <end>
36 <start> new air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft but they are also designed and approved by the fa@@ a to be resistant to electronic interference <end>
20 <start> airlines have been offering wi @-@ fi use at cru@@ ising al@@ titudes to passengers for several years <end>
16 <start> plan@@ es modified for wi @-@ fi systems are also more resistant to interference <end>
24 <start> the vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines hu@@ er@@ ta said <end>
20 <start> today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations of devices <end>
17 <start> e @-@ readers for example em@@ it only minimal trans@@ missions when turning a page <end>
14 <start> but trans@@ missions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data <end>
22 <start> among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been amaz@@ on@@ .com <end>
30 <start> in 2011 company officials loaded an air@@ liner full of their kin@@ dle e @-@ readers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none <end>
19 <start> fa@@ a advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk <end>
31 <start> douglas k@@ id@@ d of the national association of air@@ line pas@@ sen@@ gers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal <end>
34 <start> other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems and most of those reports are very old <end>
25 <start> however the committee recommended the fa@@ a allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low visibility <end>
24 <start> a travel industry group welcomed the changes calling them common @-@ sense accommodations for a traveling public now bri@@ stling with technology <end>

12 <start> is europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with britain <end>
36 <start> business for britain launched in april with a pledge to bring business together and define what the uk &apos;s wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the eu <end>
29 <start> to that end we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive po@@ ll of british business leaders asking them for their thoughts on britain business and the eu <end>
21 <start> you@@ go@@ v poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders broadly representative of britain &apos;s business sizes sectors and regions <end>
15 <start> the conclusions of the po@@ ll will come as a surprise to many <end>
34 <start> we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of europe focusing on countries that are modernis@@ ing and growing while the eu states stag@@ n@@ ate <end>
43 <start> they want to see the government priori@@ tise new trading links with the likes of china india and brazil rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the eu &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions <end>
36 <start> when asked their views on specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to west@@ min@@ ster <end>
50 <start> there was general dis@@ content with the single market with businesses saying that the costs of brussels regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of europe &apos;s trading area even 40 per cent of large businesses traditionally the most pro @-@ european of companies agreed <end>
43 <start> finally and most t@@ ell@@ ingly of all our po@@ ll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the eu that is based on trade not politics <end>
32 <start> this finding which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the uk <end>
32 <start> the st@@ akes are high achieving treaty change and a better deal for britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the eu in a referendum <end>
33 <start> the prime minister should be in no doubt this po@@ ll shows that british business backs his plan for ren@@ egoti@@ ating the terms of britain &apos;s membership of the eu <end>
27 <start> it also shows that business expects that ren@@ egoti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the uk <end>
27 <start> a better deal for british business is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone emb@@ arks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union <end>
38 <start> the priority must be jobs and growth in britain and as the findings of our po@@ ll show for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in brussels &quot; regulatory approach <end>

35 <start> &quot; spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; explained u@@ te h@@ enk@@ el@@ mann the owner of the local health food store which provides a host of special products for v@@ eg@@ ans <end>

44 <start> the new ze@@ al@@ ander has been v@@ eg@@ an for 13 years and in lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m he can find almost everything that he needs to get by &quot; in 1997 i adjusted my diet and became a vegetarian &quot; <end>
18 <start> at the turn of the millennium i took the next step and became v@@ eg@@ an <end>
31 <start> &quot; however it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced me but also my choice of shoes &quot; said proc@@ tor who pre@@ fers artificial leather over normal leather <end>
16 <start> he realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products <end>
14 <start> first and foremost being v@@ eg@@ an is a matter of ethics <end>
34 <start> &quot; i don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me &quot; said proc@@ tor expressing the ma@@ x@@ im of v@@ eg@@ ans which applies to all their consumer behaviour <end>
29 <start> rather than missing bur@@ gers scra@@ mb@@ led eggs or gum@@ mi bears the v@@ eg@@ an has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him <end>
68 <start> &quot; it is a double bonus &quot; says proc@@ tor now &quot; in actual fact being v@@ eg@@ an is not about doing without it &apos;s not about as@@ ce@@ ticism but rather it is an enhan@@ cement &quot; regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options proc@@ tor puts this down to force of hab@@ it <end>
19 <start> and it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well @-@ inten@@ tioned attempt failing <end>
28 <start> &quot; the temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up similar to with smoking &quot; says proc@@ tor providing a comparison <end>
15 <start> and he argues &quot; certain flavours are not linked to animal produce &quot; <end>
16 <start> often it is the herbs or the type of preparation that provide the flavour <end>
19 <start> &quot; you can however create the same effect in other ways &quot; explains the v@@ eg@@ an <end>
27 <start> for example when attending a barbecue party proc@@ tor brings auber@@ g@@ ines mus@@ h@@ rooms and also a few v@@ eg@@ an saus@@ ages <end>
18 <start> he ensures a balanced varied diet whereby everything should also have a good hear@@ ty flavour <end>
19 <start> of course you want to have something with a bit of b@@ ite that is fair enough <end>
21 <start> &quot; it should be tasty but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean animal @-@ based food &quot; said proc@@ tor <end>
19 <start> he has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders another wide @-@ spread assumption <end>
11 <start> conver@@ ting has had a positive effect for me <end>
19 <start> i do not consume any foreign ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and have increased my vit@@ amin intake <end>
15 <start> there are top athletes who also have an exclusively v@@ eg@@ an diet <end>
20 <start> &quot; my blood values are excellent i have myself checked on a regular basis &quot; revealed proc@@ tor <end>
19 <start> many critics of v@@ eg@@ anism warn in particular of the lack of vit@@ amin b@@ 12 <end>
38 <start> &quot; because animals are fed on fo@@ d@@ der instead of gra@@ zing it is dubious whether the vit@@ amin b@@ 12 content in meat sold in free@@ zers is actually high &quot; commented proc@@ tor <end>
25 <start> for v@@ eg@@ ans there is also the option of taking the co @-@ enz@@ y@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets <end>
12 <start> &quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine &quot; he explained <end>
13 <start> proc@@ tor does not have to travel far to buy food <end>
19 <start> there are basic foodstuffs available everywhere and every supermarket now has so@@ ya milk and other products <end>
9 <start> i can find everything i need locally <end>
10 <start> i only purchase special items now and again <end>
39 <start> &quot; many people overlook the fact that even though ready @-@ made v@@ eg@@ an products are expensive it is well @-@ known that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; ready @-@ made products <end>
22 <start> in any case the preparation of v@@ eg@@ an dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed <end>
32 <start> &quot; in home cooking there is much to be discovered with a few minor t@@ weak@@ s you can achieve good if not sometimes better results &quot; said proc@@ tor <end>
47 <start> mar@@ gar@@ ine in place of butter a little more bak@@ ing powder and bi@@ car@@ bon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of egg proc@@ tor has even managed to aston@@ ish his in @-@ laws with his v@@ eg@@ an cheese c@@ akes <end>
13 <start> the v@@ eg@@ an adds new sp@@ ice to family parties <end>
16 <start> when you cook together there is a certain dynamic cooking takes on new value <end>
19 <start> &quot; the situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves &quot; said proc@@ tor <end>
11 <start> of course he has already met with scep@@ ticism <end>
10 <start> do you not like my food any more <end>
27 <start> &quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk &quot; as a v@@ eg@@ an you have to be tac@@ tful in such matters <end>
30 <start> &quot; i do not dis@@ approve of people i am part of this society &quot; said proc@@ tor explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation <end>
38 <start> and on closer observation the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un @-@ v@@ eg@@ an &apos; and v@@ eg@@ ans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed <end>
7 <start> fast food is also permitted <end>
6 <start> chips are available everywhere <end>
24 <start> &quot; many don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab houses offer fal@@ af@@ el or even vegetarian yu@@ f@@ ka &quot; says proc@@ tor <end>
27 <start> in a p@@ izz@@ eria he avoi@@ ds pasta dishes or just orders a p@@ izza without cheese all just a question of hab@@ it <end>
8 <start> restaurants are slowly adapting to things <end>
42 <start> &quot; when i began eating a v@@ eg@@ an diet 13 years ago things were even more difficult &quot; says the new ze@@ al@@ ander and he points out &quot; you have to talk with people make them aware &quot; <end>
21 <start> &quot; if enough requests are made they will perhaps be inc@@ lined to expand their menus &quot; he hopes <end>
22 <start> there are v@@ eg@@ an restaurants opening up such as the kom@@ b√º@@ se in mannheim or caf√© vogel@@ frei <end>
21 <start> proc@@ tor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one v@@ eg@@ an dish on the menu <end>
12 <start> essen@@ ti@@ ally v@@ eg@@ an dishes are for everyone <end>
13 <start> anyone can eat them they are the exact opposite of exclusive <end>
29 <start> &quot; me@@ at dishes on the other hand are exclusive in the tru@@ est sense of the word as they rule others out &quot; assessed proc@@ tor <end>
33 <start> &quot; if you want to avoid food scand@@ als v@@ eg@@ anism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scand@@ als from the outset &quot; says proc@@ tor <end>
14 <start> however purchasing v@@ eg@@ an products can be difficult to start with <end>
46 <start> o@@ in@@ ce you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ uts in particular may also contain animal additives as a col@@ ou@@ rant people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hur@@ d@@ les and pit@@ falls <end>
62 <start> therefore for this reason and others re@@ ub@@ en proc@@ tor and l@@ ars thom@@ sen have written a book &quot; veg@@ an@@ is@@ si@@ mo tier@@ ische <unk> stoffe und ihre <unk> &quot; veg@@ an@@ is@@ si@@ mo anim@@ al in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents and their altern@@ atives explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents <end>
46 <start> &quot; you gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for &quot; proc@@ tor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stum@@ ble &quot; <end>
17 <start> veg@@ anism is an important moral comp@@ ass which has an effect on your consciousness <end>
27 <start> perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old habits altogether but at least he manages to teach consumers to critically question their habits <end>

34 <start> to find out more about how dogs react to the lo@@ p @-@ sided tail w@@ ags of other dogs the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs <end>

21 <start> it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way sometimes the other <end>
57 <start> pro@@ f vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gara said &quot; we presented dogs with movies of dogs either a natu@@ rali@@ stic version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right &quot; <end>

26 <start> pro@@ f vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gara said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were inten@@ tionally communicating with each other through these movements <end>
23 <start> instead he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and sh@@ ouldn &apos;t feel worried about <end>
47 <start> he said &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour you respond on the basis of that experience &quot; <end>
23 <start> the researchers say the findings could give owners v@@ ets and tra@@ iners a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions <end>
41 <start> do@@ g behaviour expert john brad@@ sha@@ w a visiting fellow at the university of bristol &apos;s school of veterinary science said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines <end>
38 <start> last year a team from the university of l@@ incol@@ n found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog <end>
54 <start> and in another research paper from the university of victoria in canada he said &quot; do@@ gs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right rather than becoming anxious the opposite way around to the italian study &quot; <end>
32 <start> he said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or rob@@ o @-@ dogs as can@@ ines <end>
15 <start> a study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help he explained <end>
46 <start> &quot; while there is considerable evidence from many different m@@ amm@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out and dogs are no exception &quot; he said <end>
32 <start> however given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way sometimes the other <end>

12 <start> pope francis to name first car@@ din@@ als in february <end>
26 <start> pope francis will create new car@@ din@@ als of the catholic church for his first time on february 22 the vati@@ can announced thursday <end>
46 <start> car@@ din@@ als are the highest @-@ ranking cl@@ ergy in the catholic church below the pop@@ e and they &apos;re the ones who elect pop@@ es so francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor <end>
10 <start> there are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als <end>
37 <start> however once a car@@ dinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ dinal elec@@ tors &quot; <end>
49 <start> in a statement announ@@ cing the news father feder@@ ico lom@@ bar@@ di a vati@@ can spokes@@ man said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als known as a consi@@ story <end>
48 <start> &quot; pope francis has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke february &apos;s consi@@ story in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world &quot; lom@@ bar@@ di said <end>
25 <start> jack val@@ ero of catholic vo@@ ices said that by february the number of car@@ dinal elec@@ tors was likely to have dropped <end>
42 <start> he said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ dinal elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted <end>
27 <start> next year &apos;s consi@@ story would be significant because it would be the first since francis was elected in march this year val@@ ero said <end>
17 <start> at the moment there is a sort of bias towards europe and especially towards italy <end>
32 <start> &quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will nom@@ inate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance &quot; he said <end>
23 <start> for@@ ty percent of roman catho@@ lics are in south america but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als <end>
44 <start> the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since francis formed the council of car@@ din@@ als a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the church <end>
12 <start> in the past the pope decided everything on his own <end>
19 <start> &quot; now francis has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him &quot; val@@ ero said <end>
20 <start> he said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that francis would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice <end>
17 <start> but we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new <end>
40 <start> val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elev@@ ated bis@@ hops from large places to the position of car@@ dinal but that francis was &quot; full of surprises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name &quot; <end>

19 <start> n@@ ath@@ an@@ iel p. mor@@ ris is a second @-@ year student at harvard medical school <end>
12 <start> i &apos;m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days <end>
32 <start> it &apos;s a book that i thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dru@@ ms of second @-@ year medical school and renew in me a sense of hope <end>
27 <start> it &apos;s called &quot; the au@@ d@@ acity to win &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ o@@ ir of barack obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign <end>
36 <start> when i &apos;m finished with my patient write @-@ ups at night and get into bed the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away <end>
27 <start> the election turned out to be a land@@ slide and news anch@@ ors p@@ aus@@ ed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour <end>
19 <start> my class@@ m@@ ates cri@@ ed with joy and my parents saved every newspaper they could find <end>
21 <start> a young team of vision@@ aries was headed for the white house and the nation was ready for change <end>
16 <start> during obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 he had an 82 approval rating <end>
8 <start> and then i close the book <end>
20 <start> c@@ utting to the present is a ru@@ de awak@@ ening like sn@@ apping out of a dream <end>
24 <start> it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory a sad reminder of opportunities gone by <end>
15 <start> change indeed happened in the years since i cast my first bal@@ lot <end>
11 <start> it was simply nothing i could have imag@@ ined <end>
47 <start> i credit obama with great and varied accompli@@ sh@@ ments from the passage of the aff@@ ord@@ able care act to our military exit from iraq the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell &quot; to the killing of o@@ sama bin laden <end>
41 <start> moreover i believe that parti@@ san obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward immigration reform a public option for health care and closing the base at guant@@ an@@ amo bay among others <end>
34 <start> but after the countless times in which i have found myself defending the obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers i &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that i can provide <end>
11 <start> i &apos;ve reached a point of political des@@ pair <end>
24 <start> republican obstruc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders nor having d@@ ron@@ es strike innocent children overseas <end>
31 <start> it cannot explain having the national security agency collect data on the private lives of americans nor prosec@@ uting whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers who reveal government wrong@@ doing <end>
35 <start> it cannot account for assass@@ in@@ ating an@@ war al @-@ a@@ w@@ la@@ ki an american citizen without a trial nor shi@@ r@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns <end>
33 <start> it cannot justify the findings of a report that says the white house &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the ni@@ xon administration &quot; <end>
30 <start> and most recently it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the aff@@ ord@@ able care act was signed into law <end>
14 <start> i don &apos;t know if this is what i should have expected <end>
25 <start> if at 18 years old i was supposed to figure out that governance may contradic@@ t the political campaigns that prec@@ ede it <end>
31 <start> obviously elec@@ tive office isn &apos;t a predictable course as the opposing political party and random events such as the new@@ town mass@@ acre will shape our public conversation <end>
24 <start> yet of all of the examples that i have listed above they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing <end>
11 <start> that is what troub@@ les me most of all <end>
20 <start> i voted for obama again in 2012 but not because i was excited by his candi@@ d@@ acy <end>
25 <start> mit@@ t rom@@ ney presented a confusing and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions <end>
29 <start> i felt that a second term for obama free from the pressures of future elections would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long <end>
25 <start> still as obama &apos;s approval rating s@@ ank below 45 this week returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder <end>
13 <start> it makes me y@@ earn for the many promises that disappeared <end>
26 <start> this week i was reading the portion of the book describing how obama suffered a huge loss to clinton in the penn@@ sylvania primary <end>
31 <start> at a post @-@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause <end>
15 <start> &quot; i want us to get our mo@@ jo back &quot; he said <end>
11 <start> we &apos;ve got to remember who we are &apos; <end>
17 <start> it &apos;s five years later mr. president and i couldn &apos;t agree with you more <end>

36 <start> the mining mag@@ n@@ ate who is in a dispute about paying a 6 million carbon tax bill made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict <end>
31 <start> the pal@@ mer united party could control up to four votes in the senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are a@@ xed <end>
33 <start> but mr pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said mr ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ ghters stood to personally benefit from policies <end>
45 <start> &quot; he &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid par@@ ental leave because if any of those dau@@ ghters get pregnant he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not &quot; mr pal@@ mer said <end>

16 <start> mr pal@@ mer also criticised the use of pen@@ cils to mark ball@@ ots <end>
18 <start> is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it <end>

32 <start> &quot; our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co @-@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and our other regulators &quot; the bank said two weeks ago <end>

25 <start> mr u@@ sher &apos;s instant message group included bankers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and c@@ iti@@ group people close to the situation said <end>

51 <start> news about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for spec@@ ul@@ ators <end>
37 <start> some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manip@@ ulate but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true <end>
54 <start> a senior tra@@ der said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices &quot; <end>
41 <start> the news came on the same day as credit suisse announced it had dis@@ missed a tra@@ der at its london exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly 6@@ m loss late last year <end>

24 <start> the f@@ dp spokes@@ person for social and youth @-@ related affairs fritz r√∂@@ hren@@ beck wants to dig deeper into this <end>
17 <start> the sunday collection is an important postal service especially in the case of scheduled post <end>
24 <start> &quot; the company is radically and un@@ accept@@ ably cutting back on this despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 <end>
42 <start> thomas bit@@ tner liberal party parliamentary group and municip@@ al association chairman is supporting his fellow group members &quot; what anno@@ ys me is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here &quot; <end>
19 <start> in so doing the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility <end>
38 <start> &quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ √ü and rosen@@ garten must still be emp@@ tied on sun@@ days &quot; said bit@@ tner and r√∂@@ hren@@ beck in un@@ ison <end>
35 <start> it is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a sunday collection on foot <end>
24 <start> in the town parliament r√∂@@ hren@@ beck asked whether the town council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter <end>

13 <start> parking in frankfurt could soon be notic@@ e@@ ably more expensive <end>
24 <start> the city magi@@ str@@ ate today discussed a submission by the head of the department for transport stefan maj@@ er green party <end>
16 <start> according to the proposal parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent <end>
38 <start> this increase will not however be the result of raised prices but rather the fact that time inter@@ val permitted by parking meters and ti@@ ck@@ eting machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes <end>
13 <start> the city council must reach a decision on this in december <end>
24 <start> the ret@@ ail committee of the frankfurt chamber of industry and commerce believes that this is &quot; not a good idea &quot; <end>
24 <start> the option of parking right outside their businesses is &quot; an advantage to smaller retailers that must not be under@@ estimated &quot; <end>
29 <start> the verkehr@@ <unk> deutschland german traffic club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long over@@ due &quot; <end>

34 <start> he suffered only a broken arm at first but an infection developed and spread to his brain creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life <end>
20 <start> &quot; there were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in cam@@ ero@@ on &quot; geor@@ ges b@@ welle said <end>
17 <start> we would have taken him out of cam@@ ero@@ on if we had the money <end>
25 <start> instead b@@ welle spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crowded clin@@ ics and hospitals getting whatever treatment they could get <end>
11 <start> &quot; it &apos;s not easy &quot; b@@ welle said <end>
23 <start> you can leave home at 5 a.m. running to the hospital to be the first and you are not the first <end>
8 <start> there are a lot of patients <end>
10 <start> some people can die because they are waiting <end>
18 <start> the situation has@@ n &apos;t changed much since b@@ welle &apos;s father passed away in 2002 <end>
21 <start> in cam@@ ero@@ on there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people according to the world health organization <end>
20 <start> for comparison &apos;s sake the ratio in the united states is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people <end>
20 <start> and even if they could see a physi@@ cian many cam@@ ero@@ oni@@ ans couldn &apos;t afford it <end>
30 <start> two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three @-@ quarters of the country &apos;s health @-@ care spending is private <end>
14 <start> &quot; the only problem they have is poverty &quot; b@@ welle said <end>
10 <start> and with poverty they cannot enjoy their life <end>
23 <start> se@@ eing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer b@@ welle was determined to do something about it <end>
23 <start> dr. geor@@ ges b@@ welle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year <end>
23 <start> he became a doctor himself working as a v@@ as@@ cular sur@@ ge@@ on in y@@ ao@@ unde &apos;s central hospital <end>
24 <start> and he started a non@@ profit as@@ co@@ v@@ ime that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care <end>
16 <start> since 2008 he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32@@ ,000 people <end>
33 <start> almost every friday he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans tie medical supplies to the roo@@ fs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need <end>
9 <start> their luck doesn &apos;t always hold out <end>
15 <start> they &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once <end>
28 <start> but when they arrive they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome a fe@@ ast singing and dancing and the best accommodations the community can offer <end>
36 <start> in these villages free medical care is truly a cause for celebration and b@@ welle -- with his big smile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun <end>
13 <start> the next morning the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients <end>
15 <start> &quot; we are receiving 500 people in each trip &quot; b@@ welle said <end>
17 <start> they are coming from 60 kilometers around the village and they &apos;re coming on foot <end>
14 <start> each of these weekend clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care <end>
20 <start> many people are treated for malaria tuberculosis mal@@ nutrition diabetes par@@ asi@@ tes and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases <end>
38 <start> others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches a pair of donated ey@@ eg@@ l@@ asses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many im@@ pover@@ ished families simply can &apos;t afford <end>
19 <start> in the evenings the team will do simple sur@@ ger@@ ies with local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia <end>
35 <start> oper@@ ations are usually done in a scho@@ ol@@ house town hall or home after the procedure patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person <end>
30 <start> with the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ing equipment b@@ welle and his volunteers work into the early hours of sunday morning <end>
17 <start> it &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated <end>
24 <start> &quot; they are be@@ ating dru@@ ms all night to keep us awa@@ ke and continue our work &quot; b@@ welle said <end>
17 <start> on sunday the team heads back to the city tired but proud of their work <end>
44 <start> the group -- a mix of cam@@ ero@@ onian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help <end>
20 <start> one man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again <end>
15 <start> &quot; this will change my future with my family &quot; the man said <end>
32 <start> in addition to holding these weekend clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on b@@ welle also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around y@@ ao@@ unde <end>
24 <start> it &apos;s this second job he said that funds about 60 of his non@@ profit the rest is covered by private donations <end>
42 <start> &quot; i &apos;m not sure when he sle@@ eps &quot; said k@@ atie o &apos;@@ m@@ alley a second @-@ year medical student from dre@@ xel university in phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a and volunte@@ er with b@@ welle &apos;s group <end>
24 <start> he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns <end>
42 <start> for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ m@@ alley who come from the united states and europe to join b@@ welle on his missions it &apos;s a hands @-@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home <end>
35 <start> &quot; we &apos;ve been able to scru@@ b in on sur@@ ger@@ ies where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for dr. b@@ welle &quot; o &apos;@@ m@@ alley said <end>
21 <start> that &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in america as a second @-@ year medical student <end>
20 <start> the student volunteers usually pay their own way to cam@@ ero@@ on often arriving with donated medical supplies <end>
20 <start> but once they arrive in y@@ ao@@ unde their board transportation and instruction are covered by b@@ welle <end>
16 <start> &quot; he &apos;s a hero without a doubt &quot; o &apos;@@ m@@ alley said <end>
22 <start> he gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the cam@@ ero@@ on people is ever@@ lasting <end>

17 <start> ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert when it comes to the cologne under@@ world <end>
18 <start> the meeting point for his tours is the cologne tourism service centre right at the cathedral <end>
23 <start> the tour begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashion &quot; we begin in the underground car park &quot; says schul@@ ze <end>
33 <start> in the 1970s the city fathers wanted a car @-@ friendly city and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall <end>
26 <start> the majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hur@@ ry past the roman re@@ lics and simply drop off their car <end>
27 <start> however anyone who takes a closer look on parking level d@@ 2 will discover an archaeological site c@@ ord@@ oned off by metal rail@@ ings <end>
25 <start> ru@@ ins measuring five metres tall made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand are waiting to be discovered <end>
30 <start> &quot; these are rem@@ n@@ ants of the roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century a.@@ d &quot; explains schul@@ ze <end>
27 <start> before returning to day@@ light schul@@ ze has participants take a glance into a dark 15 @-@ metre sha@@ ft on the upper parking level <end>
18 <start> this is the well of the old cathedral which is barely noticed at all these days <end>
23 <start> the next stop on the tour is the pra@@ et@@ orium where participants once again desc@@ end to the dep@@ ths <end>
30 <start> here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the alps the pra@@ et@@ or of the c@@ ca@@ a <end>
12 <start> one visitor wants to know what c@@ ca@@ a means <end>
60 <start> &quot; the ab@@ brevi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia clau@@ dia ar@@ a agri@@ pp@@ inen@@ si@@ um &quot; which is basically amounts to &quot; city under roman law and city of the agri@@ pp@@ ini@@ ans founded under emperor clau@@ di@@ us at the site of the al@@ tar@@ s for the imperial cul@@ t &quot; <end>
26 <start> and the pra@@ et@@ orium refers to the former governor &apos;s palace and the centre of power of the roman empire on the rhine <end>
24 <start> from the exhibition v@@ esti@@ bu@@ le a tunnel leads to the preserved roman se@@ wer measuring around 120 metres in length <end>
31 <start> &quot; if you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so @-@ called clo@@ aca maxim@@ a &quot; says schul@@ ze encouraging the guests <end>
8 <start> schul@@ ze has one more surprise <end>
24 <start> once he has collected the key from the information desk he leads the group to a 16 @-@ metre accessible sha@@ ft <end>
17 <start> &quot; we are now in the mik@@ we a ritual jewish bath &quot; he explains <end>
24 <start> the jewish con@@ gregation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the ground@@ water essential for ritual washing <end>
39 <start> to this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the rhine can be read at the lower end of the mik@@ we the origins of which trace back to the eigh@@ th century <end>
27 <start> the mik@@ we is to form part of an archaeological area at the town hall square on which construction work is set to begin shortly <end>

13 <start> le@@ g almost h@@ ack@@ ed off ro@@ cker re@@ trial <end>
24 <start> a bloo@@ dy attack within the &apos; ro@@ cker &apos; scene is to be re @-@ investigated after more than four years <end>
32 <start> proce@@ edings for attempted murder gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ di@@ ly harm and material damage brought against two 30 @-@ year @-@ olds have begun before the frankfurt district court <end>
11 <start> they are being accompanied by strict security precau@@ tions <end>
7 <start> the accused initially remained silent <end>
26 <start> they are said to have been active within the ro@@ cker scene and to have at the time belonged to the ban@@ di@@ dos <end>
28 <start> the public prosec@@ utor accused them of having stab@@ bed and beaten three men in a car in fin@@ ow@@ furt together with unknown accompli@@ ces <end>
15 <start> all the victims were seriously injured with one man almost losing a leg <end>
19 <start> the victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang the h@@ ell &apos;s angel@@ s <end>
15 <start> one is said to have been a high @-@ ranking member from berlin <end>
18 <start> it seems that the attack was prec@@ eded by a car ch@@ ase involving several cars <end>
19 <start> according to accusations this was part of a tur@@ f war and represented a demonstration of power <end>
18 <start> the two accused were acqu@@ it@@ ted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 <end>
30 <start> at the time a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloo@@ dy feu@@ d <end>
15 <start> the as@@ sail@@ ants had worn mas@@ ks and had not been recognised <end>
35 <start> the federal supreme court repe@@ aled the ver@@ dict following an appeal by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and referred the case back to the district court for a re @-@ trial <end>
19 <start> one of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another offence <end>
20 <start> proce@@ edings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime <end>
15 <start> the police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witness <end>
25 <start> the central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties which the police had inter@@ cep@@ ted <end>
28 <start> what makes things difficult is that ro@@ ckers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court they say absolutely nothing <end>
11 <start> this also applies in the case of the victims <end>
13 <start> in the first trial only one of the victims spoke out <end>
31 <start> when asked public prosec@@ utor stefan gol@@ fier of the frankfurt oder public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial <end>
14 <start> a further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial <end>
10 <start> the thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think <end>
22 <start> the night was long the music loud and the atmosphere good but at some point everyone has to go home <end>
19 <start> exc@@ ept in the stom@@ ach@@ s of those in the passenger and back seats hunger strikes <end>
17 <start> of course this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bub@@ bly <end>
26 <start> so what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pull into the next drive @-@ through to pick yourself up a little treat <end>
31 <start> i admit i am right with you with it comes to picking up some fast food late at night or early in the morning as the case may be <end>
17 <start> a few chips a co@@ ke a burger and then straight home and into bed <end>
20 <start> however on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clu@@ b@@ bers become evident <end>
19 <start> what is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window <end>
25 <start> at the weekend in particular dis@@ car@@ ded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks <end>
10 <start> &quot; why is this &quot; i ask myself <end>
23 <start> are the people too stup@@ id to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rub@@ b@@ ish bin <end>
13 <start> after all waste paper does more than spo@@ il the landscape <end>
18 <start> bag@@ s have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers thus causing accidents <end>
30 <start> however the so @-@ called &quot; thro@@ wa@@ way society &quot; does not think about such things they probably do not even know what the term even means <end>
51 <start> if you are often out and about in the evening more often than not with several people in the car you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the night clothes bottles and other rub@@ b@@ ish begin to pi@@ le up <end>
37 <start> a few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there in contrast to on the street where no @-@ one wants to tra@@ mp@@ le through other peoples &apos; le@@ f@@ to@@ ver food <end>
33 <start> i can see the day coming when towns and municipalities will get fed up clearing up and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags <end>

14 <start> &quot; you &apos;re going to get a better deal &quot; he said <end>
48 <start> the administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the aff@@ ord@@ able care act <end>
